# AmideImaps
Utility program for GROMACS calculating the amide I Hamiltonian for peptides and proteins.
# AIM
AmideImaps is only working for older versions of GROMACS. Checkout our new programme AIM, which can also use trajectories from newer versions and from other MD packages: https://github.com/Kimvana/AIM
# Functionality of AmideImaps
The program utilize mappings for the amide I mode of proteins as described in the papers below:
